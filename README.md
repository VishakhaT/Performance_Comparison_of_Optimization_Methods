**Details about the application:**
The software application compares the performance of three methods used for optimization over Rosenbrock function used in mathematical optimization. The graph generated as output shows the comparison of these methods. Rosnbrock function is a famous method for testing the performance of gradient-based optimization algorithms. 


**Dependencies:**
1. Python version 3 and above
2. Numpy - The application requires Numpy to be installed

**Details about the structure of project**

The source project consists of:

1. *project* : Folder that contains all source files and test folder

__init__.py : This file is responsible to make Python treat its directories containing it as modules.

__main__.py : This file contains the main function which is the entry point for the code.

optimize_by_ConjugateGradient.py : The function in this file are used to measure performance using Conjugate Gradient method

optimize_by_LBFGSB.py :The function in this file are used to measure performance using Limited Memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno method

optimize_by_NelderMead.py : The function in this file are used to measure performance using Nelder Mead method

*tests* : Folder contains function to test the algorithm

2. ReadMe file
